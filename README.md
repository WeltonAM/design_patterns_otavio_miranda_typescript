Welcome to my repository dedicated to advanced **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** studies, with a strong emphasis on **Software Engineering principles**, **Design Patterns**, and **Best Practices**.  
This project serves as both a **knowledge base** and a **practical lab** for applying advanced programming concepts inspired by the course:

## 🚀 About the Project

This repository goes beyond syntax and basic concepts — it’s about **thinking like a software engineer**.  
The focus is on writing **clean**, **maintainable**, and **scalable** code by studying and applying:

- 🧩 **Software Design Principles** (SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, etc.)
- 🏗️ **Design Patterns** (Creational, Structural, and Behavioral)
- 🔍 **TypeScript for Strong Typing & Robustness**
- 🧪 **Testing, Abstractions, and Interfaces**
- ⚙️ **Real-world Architecture Scenarios**

The code examples and exercises here aim to **bridge the gap between theory and professional-grade applications**.

---

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Master **object-oriented programming** and **functional paradigms** in JS/TS
- Understand and implement **classic and modern design patterns**
- Apply **engineering discipline** to real-world software development
- Improve **code quality, readability, and reusability**
- Prepare for **large-scale system design and architecture**
